# Injury Risk Prediction in Athletes

This project explores machine learning–based prediction of injury risk in athletes using structured data analysis and predictive modeling techniques.

Sports injuries can significantly impact athlete performance and career longevity. The goal of this project is to identify patterns and risk factors from athlete performance and workload data that are associated with injury occurrences and to build models capable of predicting injury risk. This work combines data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling to provide actionable insights for injury prevention and athlete health monitoring.

## 📦 Dataset

This project uses one or more athlete datasets containing:

- Workload and performance metrics (e.g., distance, speed, game workload)
- Injury occurrence data
- Athlete identifiers and match context

## 📌 Methodology

### 1. **Data Integration & Cleaning**
- Combined raw datasets where necessary (e.g., workload + injury records)
- Handled missing values and data consistency issues
- Performed exploratory analysis to understand feature distributions

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized injury occurrence trends across athletes
- Analyzed distributions of key workload and performance metrics
- Inspected feature correlations and class balance

### 3. **Feature Engineering**
- Derived additional metrics such as weekly and accumulated workload
- Scaled and prepared features for ML modeling
- Identified features likely to correlate with injury risk

### 4. **Model Training & Evaluation**
Different classification models were trained to predict injury status, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble methods (e.g., Bagging Classifier)
- Other relevant models depending on project focus

Model performance was evaluated using standard metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- F1-score
